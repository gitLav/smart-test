Because I am now actively studying and passing all kinds of tests and exams - I had an idea to complicate my life!

Seriously. A good test of knowledge cannot be easy. The idea is to create a test that makes it extremely difficult to randomly guess the answers or find them on the Internet.

And because this is my first experience on GitHub and programming I know that there are a lot of errors in the code. But now you can test most of the functions and even get the test result.

Accept any of your criticisms, corrections, comments and ideas!
